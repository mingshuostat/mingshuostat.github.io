Hello! Welcome to my academic homepage and photography gallery.

I am Mingshuo, currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at UC Davis, advised by Professor Professor [Hao Chen](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~haochen/index.html) and Professor [Miles Lopes](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~melopes/). I also receive much help from my senior [Doudou Zhou](https://doudouzhou.github.io/). My research focuses on high-dimensional methodology and theory. On the methodological side, we represent high-dimensional data using similarity graphs and construct test statistics based on the graph structures. On the theoretical side, I work on developing tools that can support a broad range of statistical methods.

I am always open to collaborations and excited to explore new research directions. Please feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in working together!
