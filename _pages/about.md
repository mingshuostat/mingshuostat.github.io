Hello! Welcome to my academic homepage and photography gallery.

This is Mingshuo, currently a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at UC Davis, advised by Professor [Hao Chen](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~haochen/index.html) and Professor [Miles Lopes](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~melopes/). I have been extremely fortunate to learn from them - Professor Chen inspired my interest in graph-based and nonparametric methods, while Professor Lopes has greatly influenced my thinking on high-dimensional inference and theoretical statistics. I am also grateful to the senior collaborator and close friend [Doudou Zhou](https://doudouzhou.github.io/) for his encouragement. Before my Ph.D. studies, I earned my B.S. in Statistics from Southern University of Science and Technology in 2021, where I benefited greatly from Professor [Guoliang Tian](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/tianguoliang.html), both academically and personally. I am also fortunate to have conduct an online research project with Professor [Kani Chen](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/kani-chen) at HKUST.
 
My research focuses on high-dimensional methodology and theory. On the methodological side, we represent high-dimensional data using similarity graphs and construct test statistics based on the graph structures. On the theoretical side, I work on developing tools that can support a broad range of statistical methods. I am always open to collaborations and excited to explore new research directions. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested in working together! 


Outside of research, I enjoy sports and photography, and I am deeply fascinated by the stars and the universe. You can find some of my photography [here](https://mingshuostat.github.io/photograph/).
